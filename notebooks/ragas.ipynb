Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.\\n\\nIf Tordek has negative hit points and is dying, Lidda can make an untrained Heal check to make him stable. If the check fails, Tordek probably loses another hit point, but Lidda can try again in the next round.\\n\\n\\n\\nACCESS TO SKILLS The rules assume that a character can find a way to learn any skill. For instance, if Jozan wants to learn Profession (sailor), nothing in the rules exists to stop him. However, the DM is in charge of the world and makes\\n\\nall the decisions about where one can learn certain skills and where one can’t. While Jozan is living in a desert, for example, the DM can decide that he has no way of learning to be a sailor. It’s up to the DM to say whether a character can learn a given skill in a given setting.\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFor example, Gimble the bard wants to entertain a band of dwarves who are staying at the same inn where he and his party are staying. Before playing his lute, Gimble listens to the dwarves’ drinking songs so he can judge their mood. Doing so improves his performance, giving him a +2 circumstance bonus on his check. His player rolls a 5 and adds +9 for his skill modifier (4 ranks, +3 Charisma modifier, and +2 for his impromptu research). His result is 14. The DM sets the DC at 15. However, the dwarves are in a good mood because they have recently won a skirmish with orc bandits, so the DM reduces the DC to 13. (Gimble’s performance isn’t better just because the dwarves are in a good mood, so Gimble doesn’t get a bonus to add into his skill modifier. Instead, the DC goes down.) The leader of the dwarven band, however, has heard that a gnome spy works for the bandits, and he’s suspicious of Gimble. The DC to entertain him is higher than normal: 17 instead of 15. Gimble’s skill check result (14) is high enough to entertain the dwarves (DC 13) but not their leader (DC 17). The dwarves applaud Gimble and offer to buy him drinks, but their leader eyes him suspiciously.\\n\\nTime and Skill Checks\\n\\nUsing a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity (see Action Types, page 138). Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action. These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement. The distance you jump when making a Jump check, for example, is part of your movement. Each skill description specifies the time required to make a check.\\n\\nPractically Impossible Tasks\\n\\nSometimes you want to do something that seems practically impossible. In general, a task considered practically impossible has a DC of 40, 60, or even higher (or it carries a modifier of +20 or more to the DC).\\n\\nPractically impossible tasks are hard to delineate ahead of time. They’re the accomplishments that represent incredible, almost logic-defying skill and luck. Picking a lock by giving it a single, swift kick might entail a +20 modifier to the DC; swimming up a waterfall could require a Swim check against DC 80; and balancing on a fragile tree branch might have a DC of 90.\\n\\nleather armor). The steep, rocky slope he’s climbing has a Climb DC of 10. With a little care, he can take 10 and succeed automatically. But partway up the slope, a goblin scout begins pelting him with sling stones. Krusk needs to make a Climb check to get up to the goblin, and this time he can’t simply take 10. If his player rolls 4 or higher on 1d20, he succeeds.\\n\\nTaking 20: When you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being'], ground_truth='The purpose of an untrained Heal check is to make Tordek stable if he has negative hit points and is dying.

See Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 33, for more information.\\n\\nDelaying is useful if you need to see what your friends or oppo- nents are going to do before deciding what to do yourself. The price you pay is lost initiative. You never get back the time you spend waiting to see what’s going to happen. You can’t, however, interrupt anyone else’s action (as you can with a readied action).\\n\\nEven if a cleric is neutral, channeling positive energy is a good act and channeling negative energy is evil.\\n\\nInitiative Consequences of Delaying: Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the delayed action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed an action, you don’t get to take a delayed action (though you can delay again). If you take a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.\\n\\nPaladins and Undead\\n\\nBeginning at 4th level, paladins can turn undead as if they were clerics of three levels lower than they actually are.\\n\\nTurning Other Creatures\\n\\nSome clerics have the ability to turn creatures other than undead. For example, a cleric with the Fire domain can turn or destroy water creatures (as if he were a good cleric turning undead) and rebuke or command fire creatures (as if he were an evil cleric rebuking undead). The turning check result is determined as normal.\\n\\nREADY\\n\\nThe ready action lets you prepare to take an action later, after your turn is over but before your next one has begun. Readying is a standard action. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though the action that you ready might do so).\\n\\nOther Uses for Positive or Negative Energy\\n\\nPositive or negative energy may have uses other than affecting undead. For example, a holy site might be guarded by a magic door that opens for any good cleric who can make a turning check high enough to affect a 3-HD undead and that shatters for an evil cleric who can make a similar check.\\n\\nReadying an Action: You can ready a standard action, a move action, or a free action. To do so, specify the action you will take and the conditions under which you will take it. For example, you might specify that you will shoot an arrow at anyone coming through a nearby doorway. Then, any time before your next action, you may take the readied action in response to that condition. The action occurs just before the action that triggers it. If the triggered action is part of another character’s activities, you interrupt the other character. Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he continues his actions once you complete your readied action.\\n\\nTWO-WEAPON FIGHTING\\n\\nIf you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. Fighting in this way is very hard, however, and you suffer a -6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a -10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. You can reduce these penalties in two ways: * If your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2\\n\\nYour initiative result changes. For the rest of the encounter, your initiative result is the count on which you took the readied action, and you act immediately ahead of the character whose action triggered your readied action.\\n\\neach. (An unarmed strike is always considered light.)\\n\\nYou can take a 5-foot step as part of your readied action, but only if you don’t otherwise move any distance during the round. For instance, if you move up to an open door and then ready an action to swing your sword at whatever comes near, you can’t take a 5-foot step along with the readied action (since you’ve already moved in this round).\\n\\n¢ The Two-Weapon Fighting feat lessens the primary hand penalty by 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6.\\n\\nby 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6.

As a gnome grows up, his mother gives him a name, his father gives him a name, his clan elder gives him a name, his aunts and uncles give him names, and he gains nicknames from just about anyone. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are rather “stuffy” about names, a gnome learns to act as if he has no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname. When deciding which of his several names to use among humans, a gnome generally chooses the one that’s the most fun to say. Gnome clan names are combinations of common Gnome words, and gnomes almost always translate them into Common when in human lands (or into Elven when in elven lands, and so on).\\n\\n¢ 41 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears): Gnomes battle these creatures frequently and practice special techniques for fighting them.\\n\\n* +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants): This bonus represents special training that gnomes undergo, during which they learn tricks that previous generations developed in their battles with giants. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it’s caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too. The Monster Manual has information on which creatures are of the giant type.\\n\\n+2 racial bonus on Listen checks: Gnomes have keen ears. * +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks: A gnome’s sensitive\\n\\nnose allows him to monitor alchemical processes by smell.\\n\\n* Automatic Languages: Common and Gnome.

      "                       DataRow(question='How do conditions and modifiers impact skill check success in D&D, and what are the consequences of failure in certain situations?', contexts=[' who is trained in them. If you don’t have Spellcraft, for example, you just don’t know enough about magic even to attempt to identify a spell, regardless of your class, ability scores, or experience level. Skills that cannot be used untrained are indicated by a “No” in the Untrained column on Table 4–2: Skills.\\n\\nOpposed Checks\\n\\nAn opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.\\n\\nFor example, Krusk the barbarian’s 4 ranks in Climb make his Climb check results 4 points higher than they otherwise would be, but even Gimble the bard, with no Climb ranks, can make a Climb check because Climb can be used untrained. Gimble has a skill modifier of –1 (+0 for his Strength, –1 for armor), but he can give it a try. However, Gimble’s ranks in Use Magic Device let him do something that he otherwise couldn’t do at all—namely, use a magic item as if he had a particular spell on his class spell list that he actually doesn’t have. Krusk, with no ranks in the skill, can’t make a Use Magic Device check even at a penalty because Use Magic Device can’t be used untrained.\\n\\nFor example, to sneak up on someone, you make a Move Silently check. Anyone who might hear you can make a Listen check to react to your presence. For the opponent to hear you, his or her Listen check result must equal or exceed your Move Silently check result.\\n\\nTable 4–4: Example Opposed Checks\\n\\nOpposing Skill (Key Ability) Sense Motive (Wis) Spot (Wis)\\n\\nSkill (Key Ability) Bluff (Cha)\\n\\nTask Con someone Pretend to be someone Disguise (Cha) else Forgery (Int) Hide (Dex) Intimidate (Cha) Create a false map Hide from someone Make a bully back down Sneak up on someone Move Silently (Dex) Sleight of Hand (Dex) Spot (Wis) Steal a coin pouch Tie a prisoner securely Escape Artist (Dex) Use Rope (Dex) 1 An Intimidate check is opposed by the target’s level check, not a skill Forgery (Int) Spot (Wis) Special1 Listen (Wis) check. See the Intimidate skill description, page 76, for more information.\\n\\nFavorable and Unfavorable Conditions\\n\\nSome situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check. It’s one thing for Krusk, with his Survival skill, to hunt down enough food to eat while he’s camping for the day in the middle of a lush forest, but foraging for food while travelling across a barren desert is an entirely different matter.\\n\\nThe DM can alter the chance of success in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.\\n\\n1. Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent con- ditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts, page 65), or possessing unusually accurate infor- mation.\\n\\nTrying Again\\n\\nIn general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a par- ticular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.\\n\\n2. Give the skill user a –2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.\\n\\n3. Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.\\n\\nFor example, if Lidda the rogue misses an Open Lock check, she can try again and keep trying. If, however, a trap in the lock goes off if she misses an Open Lock check by 5 or more, then failure has its own penalties.\\n\\n4. Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.\\n\\nSimilarly, if Lidda misses a Climb check, she can keep trying', ', but if she misses by 5 or more, she falls (after which she can get up and try again).\\n\\nConditions that affect your character’s ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.\\n\\nIf Tordek has negative hit points and is dying, Lidda can make an untrained Heal check to make him stable. If the check fails, Tordek probably loses another hit point, but Lidda can try again in the next round.\\n\\n\\n\\nACCESS TO SKILLS The rules assume that a character can find a way to learn any skill. For instance, if Jozan wants to learn Profession (sailor), nothing in the rules exists to stop him. However, the DM is in charge of the world and makes\\n\\nall the decisions about where one can learn certain skills and where one can’t. While Jozan is living in a desert, for example, the DM can decide that he has no way of learning to be a sailor. It’s up to the DM to say whether a character can learn a given skill in a given setting.\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFor example, Gimble the bard wants to entertain a band of dwarves who are staying at the same inn where he and his party are staying. Before playing his lute, Gimble listens to the dwarves’ drinking songs so he can judge their mood. Doing so improves his performance, giving him a +2 circumstance bonus on his check. His player rolls a 5 and adds +9 for his skill modifier (4 ranks, +3 Charisma modifier, and +2 for his impromptu research). His result is 14. The DM sets the DC at 15. However, the dwarves are in a good mood because they have recently won a skirmish with orc bandits, so the DM reduces the DC to 13. (Gimble’s performance isn’t better just because the dwarves are in a good mood, so Gimble doesn’t get a bonus to add into his skill modifier. Instead, the DC goes down.) The leader of the dwarven band, however, has heard that a gnome spy works for the bandits, and he’s suspicious of Gimble. The DC to entertain him is higher than normal: 17 instead of 15. Gimble’s skill check result (14) is high enough to entertain the dwarves (DC 13) but not their leader (DC 17). The dwarves applaud Gimble and offer to buy him drinks, but their leader eyes him suspiciously.\\n\\nTime and Skill Checks\\n\\nUsing a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity (see Action Types, page 138). Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action. These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement. The distance you jump when making a Jump check, for example, is part of your movement. Each skill description specifies the time required to make a check.\\n\\nPractically Impossible Tasks\\n\\nSometimes you want to do something that seems practically impossible. In general, a task considered practically impossible has a DC of 40, 60, or even higher (or it carries a modifier of +20 or more to the DC).\\n\\nPractically impossible tasks are hard to delineate ahead of time. They’re the accomplishments that represent incredible, almost logic-defying skill and luck. Picking a lock by giving it a single, swift kick might entail a +20 modifier to the DC; swimming up a waterfall could require a Swim check against DC 80; and balancing on a fragile tree branch might have a DC of 90.\\n\\nleather armor). The steep, rocky slope he’s climbing has a Climb DC of 10. With a little care, he can take 10 and succeed automatically. But partway up the slope, a goblin scout begins pelting him with sling stones. Krusk needs to make a Climb check to get up to the goblin, and this time he can’t simply take 10. If his player rolls 4 or higher on 1d20, he succeeds.\\n\\nTaking 20: When you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being'], ground_truth='Conditions and modifiers can impact skill check success in D&D by providing bonuses or penalties to the skill modifier or changing the DC of the skill check. For example, favorable conditions can give a +2 circumstance bonus, while unfavorable conditions can give a -2 circumstance penalty. The DC can be reduced by 2 to make the task easier or increased by 2 to make it harder.

Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.\\n\\nSimilarly, if Lidda misses a Climb check, she can keep trying', ', but if she misses by 5 or more, she falls (after which she can get up and try again).\\n\\nConditions that affect your character’s ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.\\n\\nIf Tordek has negative hit points and is dying, Lidda can make an untrained Heal check to make him stable. If the check fails, Tordek probably loses another hit point, but Lidda can try again in the next round.\\n\\n\\n\\nACCESS TO SKILLS The rules assume that a character can find a way to learn any skill. For instance, if Jozan wants to learn Profession (sailor), nothing in the rules exists to stop him. However, the DM is in charge of the world and makes\\n\\nall the decisions about where one can learn certain skills and where one can’t. While Jozan is living in a desert, for example, the DM can decide that he has no way of learning to be a sailor. It’s up to the DM to say whether a character can learn a given skill in a given setting.\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFor example, Gimble the bard wants to entertain a band of dwarves who are staying at the same inn where he and his party are staying. Before playing his lute, Gimble listens to the dwarves’ drinking songs so he can judge their mood. Doing so improves his performance, giving him a +2 circumstance bonus on his check. His player rolls a 5 and adds +9 for his skill modifier (4 ranks, +3 Charisma modifier, and +2 for his impromptu research). His result is 14. The DM sets the DC at 15. However, the dwarves are in a good mood because they have recently won a skirmish with orc bandits, so the DM reduces the DC to 13. (Gimble’s performance isn’t better just because the dwarves are in a good mood, so Gimble doesn’t get a bonus to add into his skill modifier. Instead, the DC goes down.) The leader of the dwarven band, however, has heard that a gnome spy works for the bandits, and he’s suspicious of Gimble. The DC to entertain him is higher than normal: 17 instead of 15. Gimble’s skill check result (14) is high enough to entertain the dwarves (DC 13) but not their leader (DC 17). The dwarves applaud Gimble and offer to buy him drinks, but their leader eyes him suspiciously.\\n\\nTime and Skill Checks\\n\\nUsing a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity (see Action Types, page 138). Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action. These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement. The distance you jump when making a Jump check, for example, is part of your movement. Each skill description specifies the time required to make a check.\\n\\nPractically Impossible Tasks\\n\\nSometimes you want to do something that seems practically impossible. In general, a task considered practically impossible has a DC of 40, 60, or even higher (or it carries a modifier of +20 or more to the DC).\\n\\nPractically impossible tasks are hard to delineate ahead of time. They’re the accomplishments that represent incredible, almost logic-defying skill and luck. Picking a lock by giving it a single, swift kick might entail a +20 modifier to the DC; swimming up a waterfall could require a Swim check against DC 80; and balancing on a fragile tree branch might have a DC of 90.\\n\\nleather armor). The steep, rocky slope he’s climbing has a Climb DC of 10. With a little care, he can take 10 and succeed automatically. But partway up the slope, a goblin scout begins pelting him with sling stones. Krusk needs to make a Climb check to get up to the goblin, and this time he can’t simply take 10. If his player rolls 4 or higher on 1d20, he succeeds.\\n\\nTaking 20: When you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being'], ground_truth='DC represents the Difficulty Class in skill checks. It is the target number that needs to be met or exceeded in order to succeed in the skill check. The skill modifier is added to the roll result to determine if it meets or exceeds the DC. The higher the skill modifier, the higher the chance of success.', evolution_type='multi_context', metadata=[{'source': '../embed_docs/Player_s Handbook.pdf', 'filename': '../embed_docs/Player_s Handbook.pdf'}, {'source': '../embed_docs/Player_s Handbook.pdf', 'filename': '../embed_docs/Player_s Handbook.pdf'}]),\n",
      "                       DataRow(question='What is the purpose of flexible chainmail in armor, particularly in relation to joint protection and its composition of narrow vertical metal strips riveted to a leather backing worn over cloth padding?', contexts=[' made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flex- ible chainmail protects the joints. The suit includes gauntlets.\\n\\ncreature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.\\n\\nThe DM judges the effectiveness of caltrops against unusual opponents. A Small monstrous centipede, for example, can slither through an area containing caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant wearing fire giant-sized boots is immune to normal- size caltrops. (They just get stuck in the soles of his boots.)\\n\\nStudded Leather: This armor is made from tough but flexible leather (not hardened leather as with normal leather armor) rein- forced with close-set metal rivets.\\n\\nCandle: A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot radius and burns for 1 hour. See page 164 for more rules on illumination.\\n\\nMASTERWORK ARMOR\\n\\nJust as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1. For example, a masterwork chain shirt has an armor check penalty of –1 rather than –2.\\n\\nCase, Map or Scroll: This capped leather or tin rube holds rolled pieces of parchment or paper.\\n\\nChain: Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with a DC 26 Strength check.\\n\\nCrowbar: This iron bar is made for levering closed items open. A crowbar is the perfect tool for prying open doors or chests, shat- tering chains, and the like, and it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made for such purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon (see page 113) that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.\\n\\nA masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield. A mas- terwork chain shirt would thus cost 250 gp.\\n\\nThe masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon (such as spiked armor or a spiked shield).\\n\\nFlask: This ceramic, glass, or metal container is fitted with a tight stopper and holds 1 pint of liquid.\\n\\nAll magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.\\n\\nFlint and Steel: Striking steel and flint together creates sparks. By knocking sparks into tinder, you can create a small flame. Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.\\n\\nYou can’t add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item.\\n\\nGOODS AND SERVICES Of course, characters need more than just weapons and armor. Table 7–8: Goods and Services provides costs and weights for dozens of other items, and costs for a variety of services that characters can purchase.\\n\\nGrappling Hook: When tied to the end of a rope, a grappling hook can secure the rope to a battlement, window ledge, tree limb, or other protrusion. Throwing a grappling hook successfully requi- res a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 per 10 feet of distance thrown).\\n\\nHammer: This one-handed hammer with an iron head is useful for pounding pitons into a wall. If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon (see page 113) that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.\\n\\nADVENTURING GEAR\\n\\nInk: This is black ink. You can buy ink in other colors, but it costs twice as much.\\n\\nAdventurers face all sorts of challenges and difficulties, and the right gear can make the different between a successful adventure and failure. Most of this gear is basic equipment that might come in handy regardless of a character’s skills or class.\\n\\nInkpen: An inkpen is a wooden stick with a special tip on the end. The tip draws ink in when dipped in a vial and leaves an ink trail when drawn across a surface.\\n\\nA few of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table 7–8: Goods and Services (page 128) are described below, along with any special benefits they confer on the user (“you”). For objects with hardness and hit points, see Smashing an Object, page 165.\\n\\nJug, Clay: This basic ceramic jug'], ground_truth='Flexible chainmail in armor serves the purpose of protecting the joints.
