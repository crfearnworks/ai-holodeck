When the sun's rays enter Earth's atmosphere, they collide with molecules and particles in the air, such as nitrogen and oxygen. Blue light has shorter wavelengths and gets scattered more easily than other colors, causing the sky to appear blue during the day. This effect is most noticeable when the sun is relatively low on the horizon, which is why we often see beautiful blue skies at dawn and dusk.\n"
