(1) In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 1st- through 9th-level spells, a cleric gets a domain spell for each spell level, starting at 1st.
The “+1” in the entries on this table represents that spell. Domain spells are in addition to any bonus spells the cleric may receive for having a
high Wisdom score.

Answer: Given that we do not have any information about the cleric's race, feats, or initial stats, we can only infer from Table 3-6 that the base attack bonus is +3.
