        "question": "If a fighter is 4th level and has a strength of 18, what is their attack bonus?",
        "ground_truth": "The attack bonus for a 4th-level fighter with a Strength score of 18 is +8.",
        "answer": "According to the provided context, the base attack bonus for fighters increases by 1 every level. Therefore a 4th level fighter will have a base attack bonus of +4. Table 3–1 mentioned in the second excerpt seems to be related to determining the base save bonuses and base attack bonuses and is referenced in the third and eighth excerpts as well. Unfortunately, the data provided does not include this table or the specific information about it. Hence, I'm unable to conclude the exact attack bonus of a 4th level fighter with a strength of 18, because the strength ability modifier is missing. However, according to the first excerpt, we can assume that a fighter would use the first Base Attack Bonus column in Table 3–1 since their base attack bonus is good. Looking at the second excerpt, we can infer that a base attack bonus of +4 would translate into a single extra attack with a bonus of +1 (presuming that the first attack has a +4 bonus). To conclude, a 4th level fighter with a strength of 18 would have an attack bonus of +4 and a secondary attack bonus of +1.",
        "contexts": "['Base Attack Bonus: On an attack roll, apply the bonus from the appropriate column on Table 3–1 according to the class to which the character belongs. Whether a character uses the first (good) base attack bonus, the second (average) base attack bonus, or the third (poor) base attack bonus depends on his or her class. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers have a good base attack bonus, so they use the first Base Attack Bonus column. Clerics, druids, monks, and rogues have an average base attack bonus, so they use the second column. Sorcerers and wizards have a poor base attack bonus, so they use the third column. Numbers after a slash indicate additional attacks at reduced bonuses: “+12/+7/+2” means three attacks per round, with an attack bonus of +12 for the first attack, +7 for the second, and +2 for the third. Any modifiers on attack rolls apply to all these attacks normally, but bonuses do not grant extra attacks. For example, when Lidda the halfling rogue is 2nd level, she has a base attack bonus of +1. With a thrown weapon, she adds her Dexterity bonus (+3), her size bonus (+1), and a racial bonus (+1) for a total of +6. Even though a +6 base attack bonus would grant an additional attack at +1, raising that number to +6 via ability, racial, size, weapon, or other bonuses doesn’t grant Lidda an additional attack. If a character has more than one class (see Multiclass Characters, page 59), the base attack bonuses for each class are cumulative.', 'Base Attack Bonus: Add the base attack bonuses acquired for each class to get the character’s base attack bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the character with multiple attacks. Find the character’s base attack bonus on Table 3–1: Base Save and Base Attack Bonuses (page 22) to see how many additional attacks the character gets and at what bonuses. For instance, a 6th-level rogue/4th-level wizard would have a base attack bonus of +6 (+4 for the rogue class and +2 for the wizard class). A base attack bonus of +6 allows a second attack with a bonus of +1 (given as +6/+1 on Table 3– 1), even though neither the +4 from the rogue levels nor the +2 from the wizard levels normally allows an extra attack.', 'base attack bonus: An attack roll bonus derived from character class and level. Base attack bonuses increase at different rates for different character classes. A character gains a second attack when his or her base attack bonus reaches +6, a third with a base attack bonus of +11 or higher, and a fourth with a base attack bonus of +16 or higher.

A character gets some number of skill points each level, such depending on the class in question, such as 6 for a ranger or 8 for a rogue. To this number, apply the character’s Intelligence modifier (and 1 bonus point, if the character is human) to determine the total skill points gained each level (but always at least 1 skill point per level, even for a character with an Intelligence penalty). A 1st-level char- acter starts with four times this number of skill points.

This third factor depends, either directly or indirectly, on the character’s class and level. Table 3–1: Base Save and Base Attack Bonuses (see below) summarizes the figures for this third factor when it applies to base save bonuses and base attack bonuses.', 'Abilities: Strength is especially important for fighters because it improves their melee attack and damage rolls. Constitution is important for giving fighters lots of hit points, which they need in their many battles. Dexterity is important for fighters who want to be good archers or who want access to certain Dexterity- oriented feats, but the heavy armor that fighters usually wear reduces the benefit of a very high Dexterity score.', 'or penalties due to their size.

No matter what the spell’s source, the wizard must first decipher the magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Next, she must spend a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell’s level).

For example, a sorcerer with a scroll or spellbook detailing an unusual sorcerer/wizard spell (one not on the sorcerer/wizard spell list in this book) could select that spell as one of his new spells for attaining a new level, provided that it is of the right spell level. The sorcerer can’t use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.', 'You discern all spells and magical proper- ties present in a number of creatures or objects.
