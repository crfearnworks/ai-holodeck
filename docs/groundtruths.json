        "answer": "To calculate the attack bonus for a 4th-level fighter with a Strength score of 18, we'll use the information provided in the context: 1. Fighters have a good base attack bonus, so they use the first column on Table 3–1: Base Save and Base Attack Bonuses (page 22). 2. The base attack bonus for a fighter increases by 1 every level, so at 4th level, it is +4. 3. Since the character has no other bonuses, we only consider their Strength modifier to add to the base attack bonus. 4. A Strength score of 18 provides a +3 modifier. 5. Add the base attack bonus and the Strength modifier: +4 (base attack bonus for a 4th-level fighter) + +3 (Strength modifier). So, their attack bonus is +7 (+4 from their class plus +3 from their Strength score).",
        "contexts": "['Base Attack Bonus: Add the base attack bonuses acquired for each class to get the character’s base attack bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the character with multiple attacks. Find the character’s base attack bonus on Table 3–1: Base Save and Base Attack Bonuses (page 22) to see how many additional attacks the character gets and at what bonuses. For instance, a 6th-level rogue/4th-level wizard would have a base attack bonus of +6 (+4 for the rogue class and +2 for the wizard class). A base attack bonus of +6 allows a second attack with a bonus of +1 (given as +6/+1 on Table 3– 1), even though neither the +4 from the rogue levels nor the +2 from the wizard levels normally allows an extra attack.', 'Base Attack Bonus: On an attack roll, apply the bonus from the appropriate column on Table 3–1 according to the class to which the character belongs. Whether a character uses the first (good) base attack bonus, the second (average) base attack bonus, or the third (poor) base attack bonus depends on his or her class. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers have a good base attack bonus, so they use the first Base Attack Bonus column. Clerics, druids, monks, and rogues have an average base attack bonus, so they use the second column. Sorcerers and wizards have a poor base attack bonus, so they use the third column. Numbers after a slash indicate additional attacks at reduced bonuses: “+12/+7/+2” means three attacks per round, with an attack bonus of +12 for the first attack, +7 for the second, and +2 for the third. Any modifiers on attack rolls apply to all these attacks normally, but bonuses do not grant extra attacks. For example, when Lidda the halfling rogue is 2nd level, she has a base attack bonus of +1. With a thrown weapon, she adds her Dexterity bonus (+3), her size bonus (+1), and a racial bonus (+1) for a total of +6. Even though a +6 base attack bonus would grant an additional attack at +1, raising that number to +6 via ability, racial, size, weapon, or other bonuses doesn’t grant Lidda an additional attack. If a character has more than one class (see Multiclass Characters, page 59), the base attack bonuses for each class are cumulative.', 'base attack bonus: An attack roll bonus derived from character class and level. Base attack bonuses increase at different rates for different character classes. A character gains a second attack when his or her base attack bonus reaches +6, a third with a base attack bonus of +11 or higher, and a fourth with a base attack bonus of +16 or higher.

These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats on Table 5–1: Feats (page 90). A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums. (See Chapter 5:', '2.

A character gets some number of skill points each level, such depending on the class in question, such as 6 for a ranger or 8 for a rogue. To this number, apply the character’s Intelligence modifier (and 1 bonus point, if the character is human) to determine the total skill points gained each level (but always at least 1 skill point per level, even for a character with an Intelligence penalty). A 1st-level char- acter starts with four times this number of skill points.
